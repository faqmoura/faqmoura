### Since 2010, working as a Tax Inspector and a Data Scientist at Receita Federal do Brasil (Brazil's Federal Revenue Service).

As an Engineer, my passion lies in utilizing technology to tackle real-world issues. My educational background is rooted in Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on Artificial Neural Networks, which led me to publish research articles and complete a thesis in this field. Over the past four years, I've immersed myself in the world of Data Science, with a particular emphasis on the use of Python.

In addition to being a responsible individual, I thrive in a team environment. Throughout my career, I've taken on numerous managerial roles, including leading remote teams. I value diversity and strive to treat others with respect and courtesy, welcoming constructive feedback and alternative perspectives.
